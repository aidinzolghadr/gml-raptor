`gml-raptor` is a ready-to-use project template for [GameMaker Studio](https://gamemaker.io) with a comprehensive [wiki documentation](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-raptor/wiki) that provides lots of classes and functions that will speed up your game development!\
[The Releases page](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-raptor/releases) contains the latest version in `.yyz` format (project template) and ready-to-import local packages in `.yymps` format.\
This repository is also marked as _template repository_, so you may set it as source template when creating a new repository here on Github.

`gml-raptor` is huge and so it comes with a learning curve. Feel free to experiment with guidance of our wiki.\
You are invited to join our [raptor courses](https://www.coldrock.games/www/courses.php), which will help you from the first line of code to the very end, the release of your game. Our courses cover most of the secrets of raptor and you will be excited, how much this framework can do for you!

## Raptor Project Setup
`gml-raptor` is not "just a library". It is a complete framework for professional game development.\
This means, you start a "raptor-project", you do not "just include raptor into your game".

You have several choices, when setting up a raptor project:

* Use the GameMaker project template that comes with the release of raptor (the classic way)

* Create a repository on github and select `gml-raptor` as repository template. This will give you a perfectly set up project directly in your new repo. This is the recommended way.

* Create a `fork` of the raptor repository. This is similar to creating from the repository template, but it also allows you to simply _merge raptor updates_ by updating your fork! **Be aware, that forking on Github does not allow you to change the visibility of a repository!** This means, forking from the public `gml-raptor` repository, will make your repository also public and you can't change it. Recommended for open source games or game jams.

To assist you with creating the initial settings, we designed the _Raptor Project Setup Utility_, which resides in the root folder of the repository:

> [!NOTE]
> The Setup Utility is available for _Windows only_.

After creating or forking raptor, just start it and configure your project. Github is smart enough, to even record file renames in its history, so your fork can still be updated, even if you renamed the project and its containing folder. 

It will rename the project and folder, create locale files, adapt encryption settings, even does the setup of the index.html file for you, if you are planning a browser game. You may start the utility _any time, even midway through development_, to add a locale or change some of the settings.
