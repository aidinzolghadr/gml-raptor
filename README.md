|`gml-raptor` is a ready-to-use project template for [GameMaker Studio 2.3+](https://gamemaker.io) with a comprehensive [wiki documentation](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-raptor/wiki) that provides lots of classes and functions that will speed up your game development!<br/>[The Releases page](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-raptor/releases) contains the latest version in `.yyz` format (project template) and ready-to-import local packages in `.yymps` format.|

## Raptor Project Setup
`gml-raptor` is not "just a library". It is a complete framework for professional game development. This means, you start a "raptor-project", you do not "just include raptor into your game".

You have several choices, when setting up a raptor project:

* Use the GameMaker project template that comes with the release of raptor (the classic way)

* Create a repository on github and select `gml-raptor` as repository template. This will give you a perfectly set up project directly in your new repo

* Create a `fork` of the raptor repository. This is similar to creating from the repository template, but it also allows you to simply _merge raptor updates_ by updating your fork! (recommended way)
